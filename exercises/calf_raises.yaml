  *How to do calf raises:*
  - Stand on the edge of a step, or, if you have a step-aerobics platform, place two sets of risers underneath the platform.
  - Stand tall with your abdominals pulled in, the balls of your feet firmly planted on the step, and your heels hanging over the edge.
  - Rest your hands against a wall or a sturdy object for balance.
  - Raise your heels a few inches above the edge of the step so that you're on your tiptoes.
  - Hold the position for a moment, and then lower your heels below the platform, feeling a stretch in your calf muscles.

  *Tips for doing the calf raise*
  - Lift as high as you can onto your toes and lower your heels down as much as your ankle flexibility allows.
  - Push evenly through the entire width of your foot. Don't push off from your big toe or the outside edge of your feet.
