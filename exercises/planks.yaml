  *How to do planks*
  - Get in the pushup position, only put your forearms on the ground instead of your hands. Your elbows should line up directly underneath your shoulders. Toes on the ground.
  - Squeeze your glutes and tighten your abdominals.
  - Keep a neutral neck and spine.
  - Create a straight, strong line from head to toes - a plank, if you will.
  - Hold that position until the time is up!

  *Things to Remember:*
  - Don't let your hips sag down to the ground. Sagging hips makes the exercise initially easier, but it's not a plank and it defeats the purpose of the exercise.
  - Look down at the ground. This is a good prompt for maintaining a neutral neck position.
  - When your form begins to suffer, pull the plug. You're only benefiting from the plank by actually doing the plank.
