# Getting up and running

These instructions make a few assumptions:
  * You have Node installed
  * You have NPM installed
  * You have Gulp installed

If you don't have these installed, you will have some issues.

### Clone the repo
Find a place on your computer where you put repos or sites or what have you. Navigate to that folder in the terminal and clone the repo
` git clone git@github.com:gcstaublin/pregame.git `

### Install the dependencies
This is where the need for NPM comes in.

Get inside the repo you just cloned
` cd pregame `

Now that you're inside the repo
` npm install `

This will install gulp and the gulp plugins that are used to watch and compile our scss


### Watch SCSS, Run a Server and auto refresh browser
If you want all the things, simply type `gulp`. This will begin the gulp watch task, which will start a server at `http://localhost:3000/`, compile scss, as well as watch for changes as well as auto refresh the browser each time you update styles.

If you want to stop the task `<control> c`


### Compile SCSS
If you want to compile scss, type `gulp sass`


### Getting up and running with SublimeLinter
Good news. We're linting our CSS, and will tell you about all the SCSS that's not in line with the rest of kickoff-css. Sounds great doesn't it. Actually it's pretty cool, but you'll need to get that set up. We're using the editor configurations for Sublime and Atom.


#### For all users
Install the [scss-lint] (https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint) ruby gem
`gem install scss-lint`

Next follow the instructions for your repsective editor.


#### Sublime
These directions assume you already have Package Control installed.

Then you'll need to install [SublimeLinter] (http://www.sublimelinter.com/en/latest/installation.html) in Sublime Test.
In Sublime hit `<command> <shift> <p>` to bring up the command palette.

Select `Package Control: Install Package`

Now begin searching for SublimeLinter by typing, select it and hit `<return>` to install it.

Next install the [SublimeLinter-scss plugin] (https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-scss-lint)

Follow the same steps as above to open package control and install.

Restart Sublime.

#### Atom
To use this config with Atom, you need to first install a linter. `Atom > Preferences > Install`. From there do a search for `linter cow` to get the [Atom Linter] (https://github.com/atom-community/linter). Download the first result that is from `atom-community`.

Next do a search on the same screen for `linter-scss-lint` and download the first result from `AtomLinter` to get the [SCSS Linter] (https://atom.io/packages/linter-scss-lint). 

Unless you want the linter to work on every `.scss` file you open, it's recommended to disable it when it can't find a config file. To do this go to `Atom > Open Your Config` and copy and paste this at the end:
`"linter-scss-lint": disableWhenNoConfigFileInPath: true`
