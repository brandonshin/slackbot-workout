# Instructions

1. Clone the repo and navigate into the directory in your terminal.

    `$ git clone git@github.com:brandonshin/slackbot-workout.git`

2. Go to your slack home page [https://{yourgroup}.slack.com/home](http://my.slack.com/home) & click on **Integrations** on the left sidebar.

3. Scroll All the Way Down until you see **Slack API** and **Slackbot**. You'll need two access these two integrations.

4. In the **Slack API Page**, select **WebAPI** in the left side bar, scroll all the way down, and register yourself an auth token. You should see this. Take note of that token, e.g. `xoxp-2751727432-4028172038-5281317294-3c46b1`. That's your **User Auth Token**

5. In the **Slackbot** (Remote control page). Register an integration & you should see this. __Make sure you grab just the token out of the url__, e.g. `AizJbQ24l38ai4DlQD9yFELb`

6. Open the `slackbotExercise.py` in a text editor and set the **URLTOKENSTRING** and **USERAUTHTOKEN** with the tokens that you got from the **Slackbot Remote Control** and **Slack Web API**, respectively.

7. If you haven't set up pip for python, go in your terminal and run.
`$ sudo easy_install pip`

8. While in the project directory, run

    `$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`

    `$ python slackbotExercise.py`

Run the script to start the workouts and hit ctrl+c to stop the script. Hope you have fun with it!
