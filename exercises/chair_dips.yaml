  *How to do chair dips:*
  For this workout, all you need is a elevated surface that's approximately knee high, such as a bench press, a stable chair (hence the alternative name chair dips), or a park bench. Prior to starting this exercise, it's advised to stretch for push-ups. Lets get started!

  - The easiest way to perform bench dips is to begin in the most obvious position. While seated on the edge your chair, place both hands by your side right next to your thighs and clasp the edge of the seat. Using your arms, push your butt up off the chair whilst maintaining a firm grip. With your arms fully extended and your butt off the chair, extend your legs directly in front of you so that your knees are no longer bent. This will be your starting position.
  - Lower yourself by bending your elbows until your triceps and forearms are perpendicular to each other (90 degrees). Make sure your feet aren't sliding and let your hips "hang".
  - Using your triceps, lift yourself back to the starting position. (See Step 1).
  - Repeat the above sequence for the desired amount of repetitions.

  Once you've become familiar with the normal bench dips and you're up for a challenge, you can progress to bench dips with elevated legs. This variation puts a lot more stress on the triceps and as a result, works your muscles harder.
